## 洋中脊玄武岩(MORB)

[Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (*MORB*)](../Page/Brief/ABC/1MORB.pdf "观看MORB原文 :ignore")

Mid-ocean ridge basalts are the volcanic rocks erupted at the global system of ocean ridges.They are the most common volcanic rock type on Earth.They provide insights into the mantle from which they are derived by partial melting and the processes in ocean ridge volcanic systems through which they pass on their way to the surface.

洋中脊玄武岩是在全球洋脊系统中喷发的火山岩。它们是地球上最常见的火山岩类型。它们提供了对部分融化产生它们的地幔以及它们在到达地表的途中经过的洋脊火山系统中的过程的见解。

## 洋岛玄武岩(OIB)

[Oceanic Island Basalts (*OIBs*)](../Page/Brief/ABC/1OIB.pdf "观看OIB原文 :ignore")

Ocean island basalts (generally referred to as OIBs) are a type of basalt erupted within the oceans, mainly in intraplate settings.Thus, OIB volcanism contrasts with the other principal types of volcanism in the ocean basins that occur along plate boundaries: mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) volcanism, where basalt is erupted at divergent plate boundaries, and subduction zone (orarc) volcanism, where lavas are formed in association with subduction at convergent plate boundaries.OIBs are erupted at volcanic hotspots, which correspond to the surface location of upwelling mantle plumes.Mantle plumes are buoyantly upwelling regions of the mantle that are thought to have unusually high mantle temperatures.

海洋岛玄武岩（通常称为 OIBs）是一种在海洋中喷发的玄武岩，主要在板内环境中喷发。因此，OIB 火山活动与海洋盆地中沿板块边界发生的其他主要火山活动类型形成对比：洋中脊玄武岩 (MORB) 火山活动，其中玄武岩在发散的板块边界处喷发，俯冲带（或弧）火山活动，熔岩在会聚板块边界与俯冲相关形成。 OIBs 在火山热点喷发，这与上升流地幔柱的地表位置相对应。地幔柱是地幔的浮力上升区域，被认为具有异常高的地幔温度。

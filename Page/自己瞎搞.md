## 英语作业二 —— 记叙文

2021年9月，正式就读于SIO，杭州还不是很熟悉。

来到杭州第一个遇到的事情就是住房子，这边的房价十分昂贵，租金也很贵。

还遇到各种中介，中介费更是不便宜，所以我们来杭州的开端就不轻松。

四天里，跑了十几个房间，换了几个中介，但是都没有定下来住的地方。

要么是因为租金过高，要么是房子太老了，几天的奔波下来，让人感受到社会生活的不易。

当然，也让我了解到与社会人士相处的各种问题，不然很容易就吃亏了。

中介的话术也十分的厉害，很容易就把人绕晕，最后给了并不便宜的租金。

好在，最后我们通过一家小馆子，知道有个房东要租房，我们便通过房东直租，获得了相对低价且优质的租房。

也算是杭州生活的正式开始。

### 英语格式

In September 2021, I am officially studying at SIO, but I am not very familiar with Hangzhou.

The first thing I encountered when I came to Hangzhou was housing. The housing prices here are very expensive, and the rent is also very expensive.

I also encountered various intermediaries, and the intermediary fees were not cheap, so it was not easy for us to come to Hangzhou at the beginning.

In four days, I ran into a dozen rooms and changed a few intermediaries, but none of them can let me settled a place to live.

Either it is because the rent is too high, or the house is too old. After a few days of running around, I feel that social life is not easy.

Of course, it also made me understand the various problems of getting along with people in society, otherwise it would be easy to suffer.

The intermediary's speech skills are also very powerful, it is easy to stun people, and finally give a not cheap rent.

Fortunately, in the end, through a small restaurant, we knew that a landlord wanted to rent a house, so we got a relatively low-cost and high-quality rental house through direct rent from the landlord.

It can be regarded as the official beginning of life in Hangzhou.

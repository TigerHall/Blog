# 铁镍硫系统

Thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data of Fe-Ni-S at high tem peratures of 1173-1623 K have been studied by several investigators Kullerud
(1) reported the 1173, 1273, and 1373 K isotherms using X-ray and DTA methods, but no detailed study was carried out to determine the tie lines in the two-phase fields. Malik
(2) reported an invariant reac-tionL1 + Lz =8+ nat 1278 K, with 8 and n being the monosulfide and disulfide phases. Lenz et al.
(3) measured the Ly + ytwo-phase bound-aries at 1473, 1573, and 1623 K, with y being the fcc metal phase. These data were assessed by IIsieh et al.
(4), and a set of isothermal sections was given by them in addition to a liquidus projection and a reaction scheme. More recently, Sutopo
(5) carried out an extensive investigation to determine the 1173 K isotherm, including tie line data in the various two-phase fields. The compositions of the coexisting phases were de-termined by electron microprobe analysis at room temperature. The samples were heat-treated -at 1173 K in evacuated quartz capsules and quenched in ice water. Meyer
(6), on the other hand, carried out sulfur activity measurements in the melts using a gas-equilibration technique.Meyerrepresented the activity data with an empirical expression andde-rived the activities of iron and nickel from the Gibbs-Duhem relation-ships using Schuhmann's method
(7). Since the phase boundary data are not well-known, this approach may not yield the best possible thermo-dynamic information. Any changes in the phase boundary data will af-fect the derived thermodynamic quantities. A preferred method is to model the thermodynamic properties of all the pertinent phases and then calculate the phase diagrams. If the calculated diagrams differ from the experimental ones, values of the thermodynamic model parameters are adjusted until there is consistency between the thermodynamic and phase diagram data. This approach will give us a setofthermodynamic and phase diagram data that are internally consistent. Chuang and Chang
(8) calculated several isothermal sections of Fe-Ni-S using a method proposed by them
(9) to estimate the solution parameter values of the melts when the binary model is extended to ternary systems,However, the directions of the calculated tie lines differ from the experi-mental results. The purposes of the present study are to remodei the thermodynamic properties of the Fe-Ni-S melts taking into account ex-perimental data that were not then available and, to calculate the phase diagrams and stability diagrams of the Fe-Ni-S system.

***Compound-Specific Isotope Geochemistry in the Ocean***

---
### Abstract

Compound-specific isotope analysis encompasses a variety of methods for examining the naturally occurring isotope ratios of individual organic molecules. In marine environments, these methods have revealed hetero- geneous sources and alteration processes that underlie the more commonly measured isotope ratios of bulk materials, as well as revealing signatures of marine metabolisms that may otherwise be impossible to isolate. Recently, compound-specific isotopic techniques have improved the reconstruction of metazoan diets and revealed a new potential of metazoan biomass as an archive of paleoecological information. Despite six decades of practice and a diversity of applications, the use of compound-specific isotopic techniques remains uncommon in marine studies. This review examines broad the- oretical motivations behind compound-specific isotopic approaches, some applications to studies of marine carbon cycling and trophic relationships, and methodological limitations. In coming years, improvements in analyt- ical efficiency and molecular or intramolecular specificity may transform compound-specific isotope analysis into a tool that can be applied more broadly and help to build global oceanographic data sets.

## INTRODUCTION

Organic matter in most marine environments is highly heterogeneous in terms of its biochemical content, the taxonomic sources from which it derives, and the relative extent of physical and chemical alteration experienced by different contributing materials. John Hedges, a pioneer in the modern field of marine organic geochemistry, made a strong case for the incredible information potential tied up in this heterogeneity:

* [T]he information content of organic molecules, which also carry imbedded stable isotopic signatures and radiochemical clocks, is unsurpassed by any other seawater component. The 1012 diverse organic molecules dissolved in every milliliter of seawater are the only constituents whose stored information approaches the richness needed to understand where the water has been and what has happened within it over time. The future of oceanographic research belongs in part to those who can learn to read these molecular messages. (Hedges 2002, p. 25)

Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA)encompasses a variety of techniques that begin to answer this call by simultaneously examining a diversity of molecules and their isotopic content. Most organic molecules contain at least two elements whose stable isotopes are fractionated during natural processes and therefore may record the origins and/or dynamics of organic matter (OM). Currently measured isotope ratios of individual organic molecules include—from most common to most rare—13C/12C (δ13C values), 15N/14N (δ15N values), 2H/1H (δ2H or δD values, or D/H ratio), 14C/12C (�14C values), 34S/32S (δ34S values), and 18O/16O (δ18O values) (see also the sidebar titled Delta Notation). CSIA uses techniques from organic chemistry and molecular biology to purify individual molecules, converts those purified molecules into simple gases (CO2, N2, H2, SO2, or O2), and measures a single gas’s isotope ratios using isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometry (IRMS). The choice of molecular targets for CSIA is enormous; analytes are chosen for specific studies based on both the scientific question (Sections 3 and 4) and the expediency by which the compounds can be isolated in sufficient quantities for isotope analysis (Section 5.2).

The most common contemporary techniques for conducting CSIA are nearing 30 years of use (Freeman et al. 1990, Hayes et al. 1990). However, at a recent meeting of chemical oceanogra- phers, CSIA was described within a category of nascent analytical techniques with respect to its current interpretive power in an oceanographic context (Fassbender et al. 2017). Large-sample- size requirements and laborious analytical procedures have been barriers to the wide application and exploration of CSIA in marine environments; improvements in the efficiency of CSIA will be necessary to propel broad oceanographic data coverage. At this stage, it is therefore useful to examine the promising directions that CSIA has introduced for marine science in its six decades of practice (Abelson & Hoering 1961).
This review covers applications of natural-abundance CSIA in modern marine environments. Natural-abundance CSIA has been used to study organic sources and dynamics across the entire size and degradative spectra of OM found in the modern ocean—from highly degraded sediments to dissolved OM, from submicron to millimeter-scale living phytoplankton and detrital particles, and from living protozoa and zooplankton to fishes and whales. This review attempts to touch on some of these applications but avoids delving into the extensive applications of CSIA that are more clearly geological, ecological, or terrestrial. For more detailed information about these and other CSIA applications, such as contaminant tracing and forensics, see the Related Resources at the end of this article.

## WHY USE COMPOUND-SPECIFIC ISOTOPE ANALYSIS?

When asking “Why CSIA?” the first question must be “Why isotopes?” Naturally occurring isotope ratios are used widely as indicators of OM sources and cycling, applied most commonly to bulk organic materials and less commonly as CSIA. In biology or ecology, isotope ratios provide a unique source of information about an organism’s biosynthetic pathways or rates or its diet; in geology, isotope ratios provide one of the only sources of data about ancient living systems, as much of the molecular information is effectively erased during diagenesis. Most modern marine applications lie somewhere between.
The use of natural-abundance stable isotopes to study OM is rooted largely in kinetic isotope fractionation during enzymatically mediated biological processes (Hayes 2001). The magnitude of this fractionation varies widely across specific metabolic pathways, imparting a characteristic imprint on the organic products. For carbon, an initial equilibrium fractionation in the inor- ganic phase leads to a range in δ13C values of substrates for carbon fixation in surface waters [approximately −12 to −8 for aqueous CO2 versus approximately 0 to 2 for bicarbonate (Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow 2001)]. From there, a variety of kinetic isotope fractionations accom- pany carbon fixation, subsequent intracellular pathways, and alteration through degradation or dietary processing. The resulting δ13C values of bulk OM in marine environments typically range from approximately −30 to −15 (Goericke & Fry 1994), though higher values are observed in coastal macrophytes, sea ice communities, and some marine bacteria, and much lower values dominate methane-driven seafloor ecosystems. Bulk δ13C values of OM are used widely to infer autotrophic sources contributing to environmental materials or animal diets (Fry 1988) and as a key component in mass-balance approaches to resolving global carbon cycle dynamics (Kump & Arthur 1999).
Inorganic nitrogen species in the ocean have distinct δ15N values due to cycling through marine
metabolisms that exploit their redox potential. Organisms acquire the δ15N value of their nitrogen substrate, and additional fractionation occurs during assimilation and biosynthetic routing within the cell (Montoya 2008, Sigman et al. 2009). Further fractionation occurs during degradation and dietary processing. The resulting bulk δ15N values of OM in marine environments typically range from approximately −4％ to approximately 8％ for autotrophs and from approximately −4％ to more than 20％ for heterotrophs or detritus (Altabet & Francois 1994, Newsome et al. 2010,Sigman et al. 2009), and very low values (−8 ) are sometimes observed in low-oxygen water columns  (C¸ oban-Yıldız  et  al.  2006).  Bulk  organic  nitrogen  measurements  are  used  frequently to constrain nitrogen sources and cycling in the ocean—such as relative prevalence of nitrogen fixation, nitrate uptake, and denitrification—as well as dietary processes (trophic position).

For hydrogen, abiotic equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during evaporation and precipitation set an environmental baseline in ocean surface water molecules, and further kinetic fractionation occurs during autotrophic and heterotrophic biosynthesis of OM and subsequent alteration during degradation (Zhang et al. 2009). In contrast to other elements, δ2H values of bulk marine OM are not measured frequently due to extensive exchange between hydrogen atoms in organic molecules and ambient water; however, an early study in coastal waters found bulk planktonic δ2H values of approximately −170 to −100 , approximately 60–130 lower than the values in ambient seawater (Estep & Hoering 1980). In order to pinpoint biosynthetic δ2H values of biomass, CSIA approaches that focus on compounds with no or few exchangeable hydrogen atoms are finding growing utility.

Rather than kinetic isotope effects, it is the radioactive clock contained in organic carbon that makes the measurement of natural-abundance radiocarbon (14C) valuable for marine organic studies. After organic carbon is synthesized, its 14C/12C ratio decreases over time at a predictable rate due to the natural radioactive decay of 14C. Bulk measurements of 14C/12C are applied widely, typically to determine the average amount of time that organic material (such as particulate, dissolved, or sedimentary OM) has spent in a marine or terrigenous reservoir without being remineralized, assuming that the carbon was originally fixed from a well-mixed surface water or atmospheric source (e.g., Hwang & Druffel 2003). The radiocarbon content of organic carbon
in modern marine environments can range between values that are modern (�14C values » 0 , reflecting anthropogenic radiocarbon from atomic bomb testing) and radiocarbon dead (�14C values = −1,000 , >50,000 years old—e.g., communities living off of petroleum-derived carbon sources).
Given that natural-abundance isotopes contain useful information about a marine system, why then use CSIA specifically? Here and in the following sections I describe two broad end-member strategies motivating the CSIA approach (with many studies falling in between these two):

* The isotopic biomarker approach: This approach isolates biomarker compounds of a specific organism in order to investigate its metabolic pathways or exploit the organism as an archive of specific information about its environment.
* The bulk isotope deconvolution approach: This approach measures multiple organic com- pounds in order to expose the heterogeneous contributing sources and/or underlying pro- cesses governing bulk isotope ratios.

The analytical uncertainties associated with CSIA also must be considered prior to use. The overall reproducibility of the most common CSIA techniques is typically coarser [∼0.1  ≤ 1σ ≤1.0	for stable carbon and nitrogen CSIA, and ∼2	≤ 1σ ≤ 5	for hydrogen CSIA (Sessions 2006)] than that of common techniques for bulk isotopic measurements of OM (0.1	≤ 1σ ≤ 0.2 for bulk carbon and nitrogen). Natural isotopic variation between statistically sampled compound populations therefore should be more than 2	for stable carbon and nitrogen or more than 10 for hydrogen (± 2σ, 95% confidence interval) if CSIA efforts are to be effective at detecting significant differences. (For further discussion of sample requirements for isotopic studies, see Section 5.2 and Teece & Fogel 2004.)

## ISOTOPIC BIOMARKERS

Identifying and isolating bulk cellular biomass is a viable method for isotopic studies of discrete organisms that can be physically separated manually (e.g., animals or macrophytes) or by flow cytometry (e.g., categories of phytoplankton isolated for bulk nitrogen or carbon isotope analysis) (Fawcett et al. 2011, Hansman & Sessions 2016). However, most marine microorganisms cannot be isolated readily out of natural samples, and cells are quickly lysed upon death. Isotopic studies of most living microorganisms and nonliving OM must instead use proxy compounds. The isotopic biomarker approach ( Jasper & Hayes 1990, Schouten et al. 1998) homes in on molecules with specific taxonomic origins in order to tune out the noise induced in the bulk isotopic composition of environmental mixtures from source mixing, degradative, and trophic effects (Bidigare et al. 1991) (Figure 1a). For a specific molecule to act as a proxy for isotope ratios of its precursor organism, its taxonomic origins must be known, and there must be a predictable relationship between isotope ratios in the biomarker and the environmental or metabolic parameter of interest. These details can be established through the manipulation of environmental variables in well-controlled cultures, but some biomarker associations are first discovered in the environment.
Perhaps the most widely targeted biomarkers for CSIA have been those specific to phytoplank- ton. Since phytoplankton fix carbon and live in a narrow surface depth range that receives adequate sunlight, their carbon isotope ratios bear a direct relationship to surface ocean–atmosphere CO2 equilibrium, and aspects of their physiology may reflect other conditions of the surface ocean, such as temperature. Photosynthetic pigments have been a prominent CSIA target. In addition to being specific to photoautotrophs, many pigments contain both carbon and nitrogen atoms that retain original isotope ratios even after some sedimentary diagenesis and therefore can be used to infer past carbon and nitrogen processes in the surface ocean (Higgins et al. 2010, Kennicutt et al. 1992, Sachs & Repeta 2000). Taxonomically specific photosynthetic biomarkers such as alkenones have an advantage over pigments due to the ability to determine—in cultured organisms—quantitative relationships between isotope ratios and environmental or physiological variables (e.g., Bidigare et al. 1997, Wilkes et al. 2018). Alkenones are long-chain compounds synthesized only by certain haptophyte algae and are also long lived in sediments. Although they do not contain nitrogen, their carbon isotope ratios—when compared with δ13C values of dissolved inorganic carbon— have been proposed as proxies for present or past CO2 concentrations (e.g., Jasper & Hayes 1990, Pagani et al. 2002), and their hydrogen isotope ratios have been proposed as proxies for surface ocean salinity (Schouten et al. 2006). Similarly, some sterol, highly branched isoprenoid, and fatty acid structures can also be diagnostic for specific groups of algae and can be used as proxies for δ13C values of their source organisms (Belt et al. 2008, Popp et al. 1999, Tolosa et al. 2008).
Biomarker CSIA approaches also have identified taxa responsible for unique metabolic sig- natures. Large gradients in carbon and nitrogen isotopes are often observed across oxic–anoxic transitions  in  marine  water  columns  and  sediments  (C¸ oban-Yıldız  et  al.  2006,  Glaubitz  et  al. 2009, Wakeham et al. 2012). Anomalously low or high isotope ratios in biomarkers specific to certain microbes can identify dominant taxa (broad or specific) and metabolisms. For example, in anoxic water column and seafloor environments where methane cycling predominates, the rela- tive δ13C values of individual lipids deriving from archaea and bacteria have clarified the role of each group in the anaerobic oxidation of methane, notably before these archaea were identified taxonomically (Elvert et al. 1999, Hinrichs et al. 2000, Wakeham et al. 2003). Similarly, Jahnke et al. (1995) detected 13C-depleted (δ13C ≈ −70 ) lipid biomarkers specific to methanotrophic bacteria in the gills but not in other tissues of chemosymbiotic mussels from cold seeps, thus confirming chemically an important physiological association of aerobic methane symbiosis in bivalves. In investigations of the Black Sea sedimentary record, relatively high δ13C values (ap- proximately −16％) of preserved isorenieratene, a biomarker for anoxygenic photoautotrophs

Items in green represent autotrophic biomass; in red, heterotrophic biomass; and in brown, detritus. (a) The isotopic biomarker approach singles out molecules with utility as proxies for specific organismal biomass or for environmental conditions. (b) Isotopic heterogeneity originating in different primary metabolisms can propagate through mixing of material of diverse origins and can be compounded with physical sorting to partition isotopic heterogeneities in different heterotrophic organisms and organic matter phases. (c) Aerobic heterotrophs tend to accumulate heavy isotopes in biomass and expel light isotopes as the waste products of intracellular enzymatic reactions. Compound-specific patterns resulting from heterotrophic pathways can be used to differentiate this heavy isotope enrichment from that caused by the mechanisms shown in panels b and e. (d ) An example network of intracellular chemical reactions (left) shows carbon fluxes (arrows) between reactants and products (capital letters), the maximal isotopic fractionation associated with enzymatic reactions at each stage (ε), and the resulting relative isotope ratios of carbon at each stage ( / ) (inspired by Hayes 2001). The resulting compound classes contain distinct isotopic ratios; since these compound classes also have different reactivities in the environment, subsequent environmental degradation may lead to shifts in the bulk isotope ratios of the organic matter pool (right).
(e) Extracellular enzymes hydrolyze complex organic substrates, resulting in solubilization of monomers or oligomers containing more light isotopes (reaction products) and accumulation of heavy isotopes in the residual substrate (reactant). CSIA patterns can differentiate this heavy isotope enrichment from that caused by the mechanisms shown in panels b and c. Intact (nonhydrolyzed) structures can be targeted for isotopic analysis in order to rule out this effect. Abbreviation: CSIA, compound-specific isotope analysis.
(certain species of Chlorobiaceae), showed the time periods over which photosynthesis operating via the reverse tricarboxylic acid pathway thrived in a euphotic chemocline (Sinninghe Damste´ et al. 1993). High δ13C values of bacterial fatty acids also have shown that chemoautotrophic metabolisms using the reverse tricarboxylic acid pathway dominate the dark chemocline of the Baltic Sea (Glaubitz et al. 2009).
CSIA of specific biomarkers also can confirm the presence and unique metabolic pathways of organisms that may exist in insufficient quantities to affect bulk OM. This approach has been particularly useful in elucidating the metabolisms of several marine prokaryotes whose natural functioning is difficult to replicate in culture. For example, the carbon fixation pathway of bacteria responsible for marine anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox)—a major pathway for the loss of fixed nitrogen—was unknown until the δ13C values of diagnostic ladderane fatty acids were measured in natural marine samples (Schouten et al. 2004). Similarly, archaea synthesize mem- brane lipids—glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs)—that are not produced by other domains of life and are therefore diagnostic for archaeal biomass. Hoefs et al. (1997) first sug- gested that mesophilic archaea from oxygenated marine water columns may be chemoautotrophic based on δ13C values of hydrocarbon moieties from GDGTs (biphytanes) years before this was confirmed by incubation studies. Exploiting the old age (low radiocarbon content) of ambient dissolved inorganic carbon used as a substrate for deep-ocean chemoautotrophy, Ingalls et al. (2006) used the radiocarbon content of individual GDGTs to determine that mesopelagic archaea in the Pacific employed approximately 83% chemoautotrophy and 17% heterotrophy. The δ13C values of intact GDGTs recently have shown promise for revealing additional details about the autotrophic versus heterotrophic nature of diverse natural archaeal assemblages (Pearson et al. 2016).
Both alkenones and GDGTs—independent of isotope ratios—are also used as paleotempera- ture proxies, because variations in the molecular structure (numbers of unsaturations and rings, respectively) correlate with growth temperature. This additional incentive for establishing modern environmental correlations has motivated extensive study of these molecules in the contemporary ocean. In particular, the wide measurement of δ13C values of algal biomarkers such as alkenones has produced some of the few basin-scale CSIA studies to date, enabling some of the first spatial correlations of physiological isotope effects with broad-scale, natural, and complex oceanographic variables (Bidigare et al. 1997, Pagani et al. 2002, Popp et al. 1999) (Figure 2).

* Selection of bulk and compound-specific lipid carbon isotope data from surface waters along the Princess Elizabeth Trough in the Southern Ocean. Bulk POM contains organic matter originating from all contributing biological sources. Phytol derives from chlorophyll and thus represents the overall photosynthetic community. The negative offset between δ13C values of bulk POM and phytol is expected due to isotopic fractionation during the synthesis of lipids. The latitudinal trend in bulk δ13C values was attributed to the effects of varying CO2 concentration and phytoplankton community, and the similarity between spatial trends in POM and phytol suggests that most surface-water POM is closely tied to a photosynthetic source. Sterol I in this study was cholesta-5,22E-dien-3β-ol, which derives from a subset of the eukaryotic phytoplankton community. Dissimilar trends in sterol I and phytol in the northward segment suggest that carbon isotope fractionation by producers of sterol I is controlled by different environmental or growth rate factors than the average phytoplankton community. Measurement uncertainty was similar to the size of the symbols. Abbreviation: POM, particulate organic matter. Data from Popp et al. (1999).

## BULK ISOTOPE DECONVOLUTION

In marine environments, diverse biologically mediated processes and attendant kinetic isotope fractionations occur across numerous physical phases. Physical and biological reworking of OM may redistribute these isotopic variations across new environments and timescales. As a result, many materials in marine environments—including the biomass of animals with mixed diets— represent a heterogeneous mixture of sources and processes, rendering bulk isotope ratios difficult to interpret. To address overall organic sources and cycling, more ubiquitous rather than targeted biomarker compounds are often used, along with multiple molecular targets (in some cases devel- oping an isotopic fingerprint), to deconvolve the multiple effects underlying bulk OM properties. Below, I outline CSIA strategies used to identify four major mechanisms underlying variations in bulk isotope ratios. Notably, all four mechanisms may affect a single bulk isotopic measurement.

### Heterogeneous Primary Sources of Organic Matter

Carbon fixation on land and in the ocean by a wide variety of photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms leads to a range in δ13C values of primary OM. Heterogeneities in bulk biosynthetic products arise from differences in inorganic carbon substrate (∼9％ variation), fractionation during CO2 diffusion into the cell (∼4 variation), inorganic carbon sequestration in cell compartments (∼10–20   variation), and different carbon fixation enzymes or pathways (>20   variation) (Laws et al. 2002, O’Leary 1988, Pearson 2010). Due to the wider hydrologic variation in terrestrial environments, the δ2H values of terrigenous OM span a wider range than, and are often distinct from, marine sources. In addition, autotrophic metabolisms utilize nitrogen substrates with varying δ15N values. Finally, biomass deriving from these diverse sources may remain and mix in marine environments for varying periods of time, leading to heterogeneities in 14C content (age) (Eglinton et al. 1997). Physical or dietary mixing of diverse source material can therefore lead to bulk isotope ratios representing a sometimes-deceptive average value. CSIA can reveal these heterogeneous sources (Figure 1b).
Terrigenous OM contributes significant amounts of carbon to the coastal ocean, and its δ13C value is different enough from marine phytoplankton that it is used widely to construct mixing models and estimate terrigenous contributions to marine environments. However, such models depend on the isotope ratios of end-member sources being well constrained. End-member δ13C values of marine phytoplankton may vary widely (see below), and terrigenous OM also varies widely based on the relative contributions of C3 and C4 plants to the active watershed. Bulk isotopic and elemental properties alone can be ambiguous, as a mixture of C3 (δ13C ≈ −30
to −25 ) and C4 (δ13C ≈ −16 to −10 ) plant end members (Pancost and Boot 2004) can
resemble planktonic marine OM (δ13C ≈ −24 to −19 ), and additional sources such as fossil, methanogenic, or anthropogenic carbon may be present (e.g., Freeman et al. 1994).
Biomarkers specific to vascular plants, such as long-chain n-alkanes or lignin phenols, can serve as proxies for terrigenous end members (Pancost & Boot 2004). The δ13C values of lignin phenols have been particularly important in determining terrigenous sources contributing to sediments in the Gulf of Mexico (Gon˜ i et al. 1997). These revealed that C3 and C4 plant materials eroded by the Mississippi River were associated with different grain sizes. The hydrodynamic sorting of these materials thereby imposed isotopic sorting in the resulting proximal and distal offshore sedimentary deposits.
Heterogeneous δ13C and �14C values of diverse individual molecules in marginal sediments continue to reveal magnitudes of terrigenous input, variable aging of terrigenous inputs due to varying residence times in soil or aquatic reservoirs before erosion, and unforeseen petrogenic erosional sources of OM (e.g., Drenzek et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2013, Pearson et al. 2001, Wakeham & McNichol 2014). δ2H values of diverse lipids in marginal sediments also have indicated mixtures of marine and terrigenous sources ( Jones et al. 2008, Li et al. 2009). Radiocarbon CSIA additionally has revealed that codeposited paleotemperature proxy compounds of marine origin actually can be diachronous due to sediment resuspension or deep-ocean sources (Ohkouchi et al. 2002, Shah et al. 2008).
Heterogeneity in the isotope ratios of marine phytoplankton groups also is obfuscated in bulk measurements of OM. A few studies have exposed significant variability in both δ15N and δ13C val- ues of phytoplankton groups using a combination of cell-sorting flow cytometry and bulk isotope analysis (Fawcett et al. 2011, Hansman & Sessions 2016; for an example of cell sorting com- bined with CSIA, see Pel et al. 2003). CSIA can be used to trace such heterogeneity from living phytoplankton to detritus, enabling the examination of the relative importance of different phyto- plankton groups in carbon export and burial or dietary uptake. Variations in δ13C values of phyto- plankton usually are attributed to differences in growth rate, CO2 concentrations, or physiological differences, including carbon-concentrating mechanisms (Goericke & Fry 1994). Environmental controls on taxon-specific δ13C differences—such as nutrient or CO2 concentrations—have been established theoretically in laboratory culture and tested by examining diverse phytoplanktonic lipid biomarkers simultaneously across environmental gradients in the ocean (Pancost et al. 1997, Popp et al. 1999, Tolosa et al. 2008) (Figure 2).
Marine phytoplankton groups also can be distinguished by patterns in isotope ratios arising across multiple compounds, even if the compounds themselves are ubiquitously produced. In par- ticular, the diversity of biosynthetic pathways used to synthesize the carbon skeletons of amino acids leads to characteristic patterns in δ13C values (Abelson & Hoering 1961, Macko et al. 1987, Scott et al. 2006) that can be used to distinguish biomass originating from vascular plants, fungi, heterotrophic bacteria, macrophytes, microalgae (Larsen et al. 2013), N2-fixing cyanobacteria, and non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria (McMahon et al. 2015) (Figure 3). These fingerprints arise in essential amino acids, which are passed from producer to consumer tissue. As a result, essential amino acid δ13C fingerprinting has been used to reconstruct the phytoplankton groups contribut- ing to animal food webs (e.g., Arthur et al. 2014) as well as past primary producer communities responsible for carbon export, as recorded in sediments (Larsen et al. 2015) or in proteinaceous growth bands of marine animals (e.g., McMahon et al. 2015).
The nitrogen isotope ratios of specific phytoplankton can elucidate which groups are involved in different aspects of nitrogen cycling (Fawcett et al. 2011). For studies of seston, there are few nitrogen-containing compounds that are specific to different phytoplankton groups. However, even though chlorophyll a is nearly ubiquitous among marine phytoplankton, its isotopic offset from bulk biomass appears to be indicative of taxonomic origins in eukaryotes versus cyanobacteria (Higgins et al. 2011) (Figure 4). Subsequently, offsets in the δ15N value of bulk nitrogen and degradation products of chlorophyll a have been used to reconstruct the proportional contribution of cyanobacteria in recent sedimentary intervals (Fulton et al. 2012). Similarly, relative values of δ15N among certain amino acids also have been suggested as indicative of eukaryotic versus cyanobacterial production (McCarthy et al. 2013).
Finally, sulfur CSIA has exposed heterogeneous sources of sulfurized organic compounds in sediments (Raven et al. 2015, Werne et al. 2008). Sulfurization involves abiotic incorporation of inorganic sulfur into functionalized organic compounds and is considered an important preser- vation mechanism for sedimentary carbon. Heterogeneous δ34S values of individual sulfurized compounds demonstrate that multiple underlying pathways must be involved, and thus that sul- furization processes cannot be adequately described using bulk sulfur isotopes of OM.

### Heterotrophic Biomass and Trophic Linkages

The presence of heterotrophic biomass can overprint the primary isotope ratios described above and therefore affect the interpretation of bulk isotope ratios. However, CSIA patterns arising from heterotrophic metabolisms can be used to identify the contribution of heterotrophic biomass to mixed OM samples and also to evaluate the diets and trophic linkages of heterotrophic organisms (Figure 1c).
Carbon and nitrogen isotopes are used widely in trophic studies; nitrogen is especially valuable due to the large (>3 ) and predictable increase in bulk δ15N values that occurs with each trophic transfer (Minagawa & Wada 1984). However, variations in δ15N values also may originate from varying primary food sources (i.e., food web base), as described above. Amino acids are ubiquitously synthesized and make up most of the nitrogen in living organisms, and are therefore not useful as biomarkers per se. However, CSIA has shown that source amino acids (such as phenylalanine) experience negligible nitrogen isotope fractionation during trophic transfer, while the δ15N values of trophic amino acids (such as glutamic acid) become enriched in 15N with a predictable magnitude of approximately 8 (Chikaraishi et al. 2009, McClelland & Montoya 2002, Popp et al. 2007). This predictable relationship allows for the simultaneous detection of both baseline δ15N values and the trophic position of the consumer from the analysis of consumer biomass alone. Amino acid CSIA has expanded greatly in the last decade and has been applied to reconstruct net primary producer communities feeding marine food webs and trophic relationships across various marine organisms (for a review, see Ohkouchi et al. 2017).
The contribution of microbial biomass to marine OM has been a long-standing question, as heterotrophic microbes are major agents of OM degradation; in this process, they may both alter the bulk properties of their substrate and contribute new consumer biomass [“catalysts or contributors?” as posed by Harvey & Macko (1997)]. Several studies have examined compounds synthesized by heterotrophic bacteria in order to understand possible isotopic shifts induced by secondary production (i.e., as contributors). The most common molecular targets have been bacterial fatty acids such as odd-chain and branched structures. Laboratory, incubation, and natural seston studies have demonstrated that relative changes in the δ13C values of OM (i.e., positive or negative shifts) due to bacterial secondary production may depend greatly on the aerobic versus anaerobic nature of the degradation process, the composition of the substrate available, and the relative extent of degradation (Abraham et al. 1998, Gong & Hollander 1997, Harvey & Macko 1997, Macko & Estep 1984, Shah et al. 2013, Teece et al. 1999).
The flexibility of amino acid metabolism in microbes gives rise to scattering in amino acid δ15N values that can be useful for distinguishing relative contributions of heterotrophic microbial biomass (the bV parameter) (McCarthy et al. 2007). Based on recent culture studies, heterotrophic bacteria and protists sometimes exhibit unique amino acid δ15N patterns, thus complicating the potential interpretation of trophic positions in seston (Gutierrez-Rodriguez et al. 2014, Yamaguchi et al. 2017). Applications of nitrogen CSIA of amino acids to dissolved, particulate, and sedimentary OM have been limited but are beginning to reveal important details regarding the net autotrophic, heterotrophic, and microbial contributions to oceanic reservoirs of organic nitrogen (e.g., Batista et al. 2014; McCarthy et al. 2004, 2007; Yamaguchi & McCarthy 2018).
Additional signatures of heterotrophic microbial biomass can be inferred through the essential amino acid δ13C fingerprinting described above, as the de novo synthesis of amino acids by het- erotrophic bacteria is accompanied by a characteristic fractionation pattern (Larsen et al. 2013) (Figure 3). The δ2H values of individual compounds also show promise for distinguishing het- erotrophic metabolisms, as demonstrated both in bacterial cultures [amino acids and lipids (Fogel et al. 2016, Zhang et al. 2009)] and in sedimentary bacterial lipids (Li et al. 2009). Expanded use of CSIA to study right-handed amino acid enantiomers, which are synthesized exclusively by bac- teria, may reveal additional bacteria-specific patterns (McCarthy et al. 2004, Takano et al. 2009, Yamaguchi & McCarthy 2018).

### The Heterogeneous Biochemical Composition of Organic Matter

The four major classes of organic compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) each contain different carbon isotope ratios, determined by the net kinetic isotope effects of enzymatic reactions involved in their biosynthesis (left side of Figure 1d). Broadly, within a single organism the ordering of δ13C values is carbohydrates > proteins ≈ nucleic acids > lipids, with the δ13C values of carbohydrates typically more than 1 higher than bulk biomass and those of lipids averaging approximately 4 lower than bulk biomass (Abelson & Hoering 1961, Benner et al. 1987, Degens et al. 1968, Hayes 2001, van Dongen et al. 2002). The isotope ratios of some compound subclasses also vary predictably due to differences in biosynthetic pathway (e.g., isoprenoid versus acetogenic lipids). Individual compounds within these classes can also vary significantly; δ13C and δ15N values of different amino acids can vary by more than 10％ (for primary producers) or more than 20 (for consumers) around the mean protein values in an organism (Chikaraishi et al. 2009, Larsen et al. 2013, McMahon et al. 2015, Popp et al. 2007).
The major compound classes are also degraded at different rates in the environment: In general, the ordering is nucleic acid rates > carbohydrate rates ≈ protein rates > lipid rates (Harvey et al. 1995, LaRowe & Van Cappellen 2011). Degradation rates of compound subclasses also vary (e.g., lipid subclasses such as fatty acids, sterols, and n-alkanes) (Sun & Wakeham 1994). Since the most labile components of biomass also contain a relatively high proportion of 13C, as OM degrades, the bulk δ13C value may decrease as the 13C-depleted, recalcitrant components constitute an increasing proportion (right side of Figure 1d). This mechanism has been invoked to explain variations in bulk δ13C values along degradation gradients such as depth in a water column ( Jeffrey et al. 1983). Similarly, low δ15N values of bathypelagic particulate matter have been attributed to the degradation of relatively 15N-enriched proteinaceous material and the retention of relatively 15N-depleted nonprotein material (Altabet et al. 1991, Yamaguchi & McCarthy 2018).
The isotope ratios of individual biochemical components can be used to distinguish this com- positional shift from other mechanisms of variation in bulk isotope ratios: If co-occurring bulk and biochemical isotope ratios vary in tandem, then this mechanism is not likely to be the driver. In two studies of particulate OM, decreases in bulk δ13C values with increasing depth in the euphotic zone were accompanied by parallel decreases in the δ13C values of phytoplanktonic lipids, thus favoring a primary origin rather than a degradative compositional shift, as has been more com- monly invoked (Close et al. 2014, O’Leary et al. 2001). However, in more degraded deep-ocean particles and sediments, δ13C and �14C values of bulk OM shift toward those of co-occurring lipids (Hwang & Druffel 2003, Wang et al. 1998).
CSIA also has exposed differential turnover rates of biochemical components of dissolved OM, one of the largest active reservoirs of carbon on the planet. The total dissolved OM pool has very old radiocarbon ages and therefore slow overall cycling in the ocean reservoir; however, radiocarbon CSIA of dissolved neutral sugars revealed that these constitute a modern, quickly cycling subfraction (Repeta & Aluwihare 2006).
Additional considerations in this fractionation mechanism are (a) that biosynthetic pathways vary among taxa such that relative isotope partitioning may vary among biochemical classes, and
(b) that the relative proportions of cellular carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen routed along different biosynthetic pathways can vary with growth rate, growth stage, and other variables and affect the relative isotope ratios across biochemical classes (Hayes 2001, Schouten et al. 2006, Wilkes et al. 2018) (left side of Figure 1d).

### Extracellular Hydrolytic Fractionation (Residual Effect)

Heterotrophs—specifically microbes—can induce an additional, distinct impact on isotope ratios of bulk OM through the activity of extracellular enzymes. Most microbes must obtain nutritional substrates through osmotic uptake of monomers or oligomers (Hoppe et al. 2002). In order to access detrital polymers, most microbes therefore must deploy hydrolytic enzymes outside the cell; the resulting solubilization reactions may be accompanied by isotopic fractionation. In an experiment of peptide bond hydrolysis (Silfer et al. 1992), bonds containing light isotopes were broken more quickly and partitioned into the reaction product (solubilized monomers), while bonds containing heavy isotopes were more likely to be left intact in the reaction substrate (detrital polymers) (Figure 1e). In the environment, this reaction may involve a change in phase (particulate to soluble), products may be separated from substrate through diffusion, and a Rayleigh-type positive fractionation may be observed in the residual substrate (Mariotti et al. 1981).
If only bulk isotopes are considered, this positive shift in isotope ratios of detrital substrate may be indistinguishable from the internal metabolic fractionation of heterotrophs, but the difference is important for determining the roles of microbes during degradation [the “catalysts or contrib- utors?” question of Harvey & Macko (1997)]. CSIA can take advantage of the heterogeneity of natural OM to separate compounds that are susceptible to extracellular enzymatic fractionation from those that are invulnerable and thus identify or exclude this mechanism as a control on bulk isotope ratios. Signatures of intact cellular material can be identified by chemically isolating labile compounds that are still intact and thus have not been affected by enzymatic hydrolysis; such com- pounds include proteins, nucleic acids, and intact polar lipids. Isotopic fractionation stemming from hydrolysis can be inferred by comparing hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed structures, such as peptides, free amino acids, and core or free lipids (e.g., fatty acids and hydrocarbons).
Amino acids provide a case study for this mechanism. Hydrolytic enzymes are likely to act without regard to the source and trophic distinction made during intracellular trophic processes, thereby inducing a distinct 15N enrichment across all amino acids in a partially degraded pro- teinaceous substrate (Ohkouchi et al. 2017). Positive shifts in δ15N values of source amino acids along a degradation sequence (e.g., depth in a water column) therefore have been interpreted to be the result of peptide bond cleavage (Hannides et al. 2013, Yamaguchi & McCarthy 2018), with observed fractionations matching experimentally derived fractionations (Silfer et al. 1992). Observations have been more variable for carbon isotopes of amino acids (Macko et al. 1994). The magnitude of these degradative isotopic shifts may reveal the total extent of OM reworking; additionally, such hydrolytic signatures can be passed on to the tissues of detritivores and therefore may be important when interpreting baseline δ15N values of consumers (Gloeckler et al. 2018).
To eliminate such degradative fractionation as a mechanism behind observed isotope ratios, intact proteins—a portion of the total amino acid pool—are a desirable target for analysis. Proteins are a major component of active cellular machinery, interpretable through proteomics, and are also a highly labile component of OM and thus indicative of in situ biosynthetic rather than degradative isotopic signatures. Thus, some efforts have been made to isolate intact proteins for stable-isotope analysis (Meador et al. 2007, Mohr et al. 2014).
Similarly, intact polar lipid structures have also been targeted as labile compounds indicative of biosynthetic signatures of living or recently living communities (Close et al. 2014, Druffel et al. 2010, Schubotz et al. 2011, Svensson et al. 2015). For example, through measurements of the 14C content of side chains from these compounds, the uptake of 14C-dead petroleum and other fossil carbon substrates has been tested in natural bacterial communities (e.g., Petsch et al. 2001, Slater et al. 2005, Wakeham et al. 2006). This technique contrasts with total lipid approaches that include core or free lipids, which are more likely to derive from exogenous sources and which also may have undergone isotopic fractionation during bond cleavage from intact structures (Sun et al. 2004).
Nitrogen atoms within tetrapyrrole structures are also considered invulnerable to hydrolytic reactions (Sigman et al. 2009), as nitrogen would be lost from the structure after cleavage. It is for this reason that sedimentary porphyrins can be used as archives of original photosynthetic δ15N values. Studies of natural intramolecular isotope distributions are additionally informative for this mechanism, as functional groups containing distinct isotope ratios may be preferentially lost during hydrolysis (Abelson & Hoering 1961, Lin et al. 2010, Monson & Hayes 1982, Savidge & Blair 2004, Sun et al. 2004, Zhang & Altabet 2008).

## THE CURRENT BREADTH OF ANALYTES AND METHODOLOGIES IN MARINE APPLICATIONS OF COMPOUND-SPECIFIC ISOTOPE ANALYSIS

The previous sections examined why, theoretically, one might choose to employ CSIA. The remaining sections examine more broadly and practically how researchers employ CSIA in the marine environment. The choices of molecular analytes and elements are extensive; Table 1 pro- vides a partial account of compound types and elements addressed thus far by natural-abundance CSIA, their typical scientific targets, and applications to marine settings. Several other reviews have dealt more specifically with CSIA analytical techniques (Hayes 1983, Meier-Augenstein 2004, Ohkouchi et al. 2017, Sessions 2006, Teece & Fogel 2004; see also the Related Resources at the end of this article).

### Strategies for Data Analysis and Interpretation

CSIA can yield multivariate results for individual samples. When quantitation is well standardized, it can yield isotope ratios and relative and absolute quantities of multiple compounds in a single analysis, sometimes with additional analysis providing isotope ratios of multiple elements in each compound. However, CSIA studies have made varying use of this density of information.
Many CSIA studies target individual compounds to represent end members for isotope mixing models, which can be as simple as using two-end-member linear models to calculate compositional mixing within the bulk pool. In more complex linear mixing models, multiple isotope systems measured on multiple compounds and/or relative compound abundances can be combined to determine a best-fit composition by iteration, solving for more than two end members (Close et al. 2013, Collister et al. 1994, Ingalls et al. 2006, Pearson & Eglinton 2000). These approaches must assume that a finite number of sources contribute to a mixed environmental sample (e.g., sediment, seston, or animal diet) and that the source mixing proceeds with no alteration (or a specifically parameterized alteration) to the end-member signatures.
Multivariate statistical tools are often employed to explore relationships between compound- specific isotope data and the large number of potentially associated environmental variables. Tools such as principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be applied in an agnostic fashion to explore covariation between compound distributions, isotope ratios, and environmental variables or sample similarities or differences with no prior presumptions about how input variables might be functionally related (e.g., Gloeckler et al. 2018, Hannides et al. 2013, McCarthy et al. 2013, Taipale et al. 2015). These and other chemometric tools are also widely employed in forensic applications of CSIA (Meier-Augenstein 2011).
In some contexts, an underlying functional relationship between CSIA data products might be understood, and multivariate statistical tools instead can be used as a classification framework, based on the similarity between a sample and a set of known end members. The readiest example in marine applications is the δ13C fingerprinting of essential amino acids described above. The end- member fingerprint of essential amino acid producers is used to statistically classify the composition of mixed OM or consumer diets, using discriminant or Bayesian analyses (Larsen et al. 2013, 2015; McCarthy et al. 2013; McMahon et al. 2015). Computational packages built specifically for Bayesian analysis of isotope data (Phillips et al. 2014) are used widely to estimate dietary contributions in isotopic studies of consumers, whether using compound-specific or multielement bulk data.
Inverse models may offer improved mechanistic interpretation of isotopic transformations in the marine environment. Such techniques have been applied to particulate materials in marine water columns, including trace metals and organic compounds, which experience both physical phase changes and chemical transformations during particle dynamics (Marchal & Lam 2012, Wang et al. 2017). While fully realized mechanistic models with statistical model–data inver- sion apparently have not been implemented in marine CSIA studies, Tang et al. (2017) used a similar approach in a broad metabolic CSIA study. The authors constructed an isotope flux model to explore how carbon isotopes are fractionated simultaneously along multiple biosynthetic pathways by a bacterium grown on different carbon substrates, optimizing the model parameters by comparing modeled CSIA results with CSIA data from cultured representatives.
Finally, estimation of uncertainties in CSIA is an important but often overlooked part of the process. Sampling replicates can be rare in nondietary marine applications. Instead, analyt- ical replicates provide the only measure of uncertainty; this must be considered when choosing which statistical methods are applicable. In addition, contaminants may be present, and data for compounds that must be derivatized in order to perform CSIA must account for the additional un- certainty from derivative atoms. These factors must be accounted for by identical and concurrent preparation and measurement of standards and procedural blanks. Error from derivatization and blank uncertainty must be propagated to determine total uncertainty and also must be propagated when calculating metavariables (Hayes 1983, Ohkouchi et al. 2017, Polissar & D’Andrea 2014).

### Current Limitations on the Application of Compound-Specific Isotope Analysis in Marine Environments

From the oceanographic perspective, the amount of information obtained from CSIA ultimately will depend on how widely the method is applied. Therefore, it is important to consider how analytical limitations have dictated the prevalence of this technique and how these limitations might change in the future.
To measure natural-abundance isotope ratios of a specific element within a specific molecule, organic compounds must be purified (i.e., physically separated) before undergoing quantitative combustion or pyrolysis. The resulting gases containing the element of interest from the analyte compound are introduced into an IRMS system. The mass analyzer in IRMS systems is used to separate isotopologues of simple gases; it cannot be used to filter out the noise from nontargeted organic components. Even with the use of online chromatography [such as gas chromatography (GC) coupled to IRMS (GC-IRMS)], usually some upstream, offline purifications (such as column chromatography, liquid–liquid extractions, and/or adduction reactions) are required to achieve sufficient purity of individual compounds (Pancost & Sinninghe Damste´ 2003). Two-dimensional GC also has been employed to refine the purification of semivolatile compounds for CSIA, both offline and online (Tobias et al. 2008). For nonvolatile compounds, two-dimensional preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is frequently employed to purify compounds offline before stable carbon or radiocarbon isotope measurement (Ingalls et al. 2006, Mohr et al. 2014). Many upstream purification procedures are laborious and are major factors determining the analytical time required; often, the full sample preparation and analysis procedure for a small sample set (<10 samples) requires weeks of active work in the laboratory.
The basal analytical sensitivity of CSIA is dictated by the ion-counting statistics and ionization
efficiency of the IRMS system itself. In addition, most contemporary CSIA applications employ continuous-flow sample interfaces, which are typically less than 25% efficient. Sessions (2006) and Elsner et al. (2012) compiled analytical sensitivities for continuous-flow GC-IRMS measurement of different elements in semivolatile compounds. For carbon stable-isotope measurement, at least 10 ng of carbon per individual compound must be injected on-column on a commercial GC- IRMS system. Requirements for nitrogen and hydrogen are higher due to conversion to diatomic gases (N2 and H2) and differences in ionization efficiency (>20–40 ng). One must then account for the proportion of the molecule composed of the target element. Using semivolatile organic compounds as examples, carbon typically makes up 40% to more than 85% of molecular weight (arginine versus cyclic hydrocarbons), nitrogen may make up 8–32% of individual amino acid molecular weight (tyrosine versus arginine), and hydrogen makes up at most approximately 15% of molecular weight (saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons). Sulfur and oxygen CSIA are much rarer and use different interface methods, but for comparison, sulfur may constitute approximately 7– 26% of molecular weight (sulfurized hydrocarbons versus cysteine) and oxygen approximately 7–40% (GDGT-0 versus pentose).
Additional practical considerations affecting sample-size requirements include (a) the desire to make measurements in duplicate or triplicate, (b) the difficulty in complete sample recovery from even total-recovery vials, and (c) incomplete recovery during offline extraction and purification techniques. Considering these additional factors, a practical guideline for CSIA is that it requires a starting sample containing at least an order of magnitude more material than is required for a single injection on the instrument (Figure 5). However, working with such small sample sizes increases the likelihood of isotopic fractionation during sample preparation. As a result, I recommend using starting sample sizes around a factor of 30 larger than the instrument requirements for a single- injection analysis—or ideally larger, as it is simple to dilute a sample if necessary.
Figure 5 provides an example illustration of a minimum sample-size calculation, for nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids from total particulate matter. In this example, practical sample-size requirements quickly become a limiting factor in obtaining adequate sample material for studies of the mid-water column, even for abundant compounds such as amino acids, especially if size class separation is desirable (10× sample volume shown in Figure 5) (Close et al. 2014). Collecting sufficient material for CSIA studies of dissolved OM, zooplankton, and micronekton in the dark ocean similarly may require many hours of active shipboard labor. Studies of animal tissue are usually less limited in sample size; however, variations across individuals in the sample population may mean that a larger number of analyses are required, and studies of growth bands or small or sparse organisms also may encounter sample limitations. Many sediments will not present sample limitation issues for CSIA, but studies conducted on low-organic sediments (such as carbonates) or finely laminated sediments may. Sedimentary and dissolved OM present additional difficulties in isolating compounds from highly complex mixtures. Before undertaking field collections, it is always recommended to carefully estimate sample-size requirements and to closely assess the entire sample-handling process for potential isotope and/or organic contamination vectors (Teece & Fogel 2004).
Clearly, improving CSIA preparation or analytical efficiency would make these methods more practicable at all stages. Some progress is being made at improving the efficiency of continuous- flow IRMS interfaces. For the carbon isotope analysis of semivolatile compounds, recent efforts have been made to couple fast GC with IRMS in order to sharpen peak resolution (Sacks et al. 2007), and Baczynski et al. (2018) expanded on this method to improve efficiencies from the GC flow path to the IRMS electronic sampling frequency. These advancements have improved the detection limits of GC-IRMS by more than an order of magnitude, enabling the measurement of approximately 1 ng of carbon injected on-column and at much faster runtimes (∼1/6 length) but currently with some sacrifice in precision (0.9 rather than 0.5 , 1σ). With care taken to prevent isotopic fractionation during offline preparation of small samples, this improvement in analytical efficiency may have important consequences for the type, number, and spatial extent of samples available for analysis (Figure 5).
CSIA of nonvolatile (not GC amenable) compounds most often uses offline rather than continuous-flow compound purification schemes. The earliest CSIA measurements were achieved by performing—in sequence—offline chromatographic purification of compounds (preparative GC or HPLC), offline combustion (or other oxidation method), cryogenic gas purification, and introduction of sample gas directly into a dual-inlet IRMS system (e.g., Abelson & Hoering 1961, Macko et al. 1987). Modern elemental analysis (EA) can be used similarly to perform CSIA on nonvolatile compounds that have been purified offline, but using a continuous-flow combustion in- terface rather than offline combustion. These approaches require sample sizes on the order of 10– 100 μg of carbon or nitrogen. However, techniques developed in the last 15 years have lowered the sample-size requirements for analysis of nonvolatiles. The development of nano-EA has im- proved sample-size requirements for EA-IRMS; the addition of cryogenic trapping and/or other alterations in the EA flow path can enable measurement of sample quantities approximately two
orders of magnitude lower than conventional EA (∼300–500 ng nitrogen or carbon) (Fry et al.
1996, Fulton et al. 2012, Ogawa et al. 2010, Polissar et al. 2008). Alternately, the moving-wire or spooling-wire interface enables the measurement of nonvolatile organic compounds separated by offline HPLC at quantities and precisions similar to those achieved by GC-IRMS (∼10–100 ng of carbon) (Brand & Dobberstein 1996, Mohr et al. 2014, Pearson et al. 2016, Sessions et al. 2005). Finally, the use of commercially available continuous-flow HPLC-IRMS instruments has been limited in marine applications due to difficulty in achieving compound purity, limitation of application to aqueous separations and carbon isotopes, and some reported large-sample-size re- quirements, but recent developments may improve some of these confounding factors (Federherr et al. 2016, Godin & McCullagh 2011).
Natural-abundance radiocarbon CSIA also is usually conducted by offline compound purifi- cation (preparative GC or HPLC) followed by offline combustion, conversion to graphite, and measurement by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) (Eglinton et al. 1996). For typical applica- tions, this method requires approximately 100 μg of carbon per compound due to the extremely low natural abundance of 14C—three to four orders of magnitude more material than is needed for stable carbon isotope analysis. Thus, both sample-size limitation and time necessary to chro- matographically isolate sufficient quantities of purified compounds offline have limited the ap- plication of this method in marine settings (Ingalls & Pearson 2005). Ongoing development of continuous-flow GC-AMS may improve this practical sensitivity by one or more orders of mag- nitude (<10 μg carbon) (McIntyre et al. 2009, Roberts et al. 2013), as well as decreasing sample preparation time. Even with such improvements, sample size will remain a barrier to the applica- tion of compound-specific radiocarbon analysis for many marine applications.

## OUTLOOK

CSIA has proven to be a vital tool for extracting information about biological, chemical, and physical processes in marine environments. It has consistently revealed that OM is isotopically heterogeneous and that the underlying mechanisms are complex, thus validating its utility in ex- plicating the interpretation of often-ambiguous bulk isotope ratios. CSIA has revealed marine metabolisms that are otherwise difficult or impossible to isolate or cultivate and has helped deter- mine which metabolisms are important in carbon and nutrient transfer through ocean reservoirs and trophic networks. It has greatly improved the reconstruction of metazoan diets and expanded the potential of metazoan biomass as an archive of paleoecological information.
However, this analytical method encompasses diverse motivations and strategies, as well as nearly infinite options for analytical targets. As a result, few concerted efforts have deployed par- ticular CSIA approaches on oceanographic scales. Using a cost–benefit perspective, we currently have more work to do to increase the benefit of CSIA by continuing to reveal the information potential of various techniques on an oceanographic scale, as well as decreasing the cost associated with analyses via improvement of detection limits and sample throughput, and therefore reduction in sample-size requirements and analytical time.
